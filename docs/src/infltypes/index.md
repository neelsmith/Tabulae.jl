# Stem types and paradigms


## Key points

- grouped by traditional part of speech and grammatical category
- each stem type is illustrated with an example entry, and a paradigm automatically generated from that entry
- examples use the data set in the `datasets/core-infl-shared` directory of the `Tabulae` github repository


Although the following pages group Tabulae's inflectional classes under traditional categories (declension for substantives, conjugation for verbs), the inflectional classes do not model any historical linguistic reality: they are purely computational conveniences.  The examples here should enable you to add your own vocabulary entries to a working Tabulae data set.
