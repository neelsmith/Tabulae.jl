# Stem types and paradigms


## Key points

- grouped by traditional part of speech and grammatical category
- each stem type is illustrated with an example entry, and a paradigm automatically generated from that entry
- examples use the data set in the `datasets/core-infl-shared` directory of the `Tabulae` github repository
