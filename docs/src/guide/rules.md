# Rules

Rules associate an inflectional ending with a morphological form.

Rules tables include an abbreviated URN to identify the rule, an inflectional class, a string value for ending, and a series of columns with morphological information that depends on the type of the rule.  Nouns, for example, have columns for gender, case and number.
