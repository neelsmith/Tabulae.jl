# Tabulae.jl

A julia package implementing the Tabulae system for building Latin morphological parsers.

Versions `0.3.x` were designed to read SFST output from the Scala implementation of Tabulae's basic ideas [here](https://github.com/neelsmith/tabulae).  

Beginning with version `0.4.0`, `Tabulae.jl` is no longer fully compatible with the format of the SFST output from the Scala package.
