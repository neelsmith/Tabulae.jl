A `tabulae` data set for Latin corpora: excludes any rules or stems involving distinction in orthography of consonantal/vocalic j/i or v/u, so that the contents of this data set can be combined with other datasets using orthographies that are supersets of this one.

Lexical content of this dataset is limited to content with identifiers in the `ls` collection, coordinated with the URN-addressable Lewis-Short lexicon from Furman University.
