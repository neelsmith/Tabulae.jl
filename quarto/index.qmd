> ☛ *Build customized Latin morphological parsers*


`Tabulae.jl` is a Julia package for building Latin morphological parsers. In the spring/summer of 2024, the previously released `Tabulae.jl` package is being rewritten from the ground up in order to implement a common conceptual model with `Kanones.jl`, a Julia package for building Greek morphological parsers, and benefit from implementation strategies developed for Kanónes.  Documentation for the revised version is being organized following the principles of [the Diátaxis approach](https://diataxis.fr).

This site is simply a placeholder until documentation for the revised version of Tabulae is available.
