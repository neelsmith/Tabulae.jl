> â˜› *Build customized Latin morphological parsers*


`Tabulae.jl` is a Julia package for building Latin morphological parsers. In the spring/summer of 2024, the previously released `Tabulae.jl` package is being rewritten from the ground up in order to implement a common conceptual model with `Tabulae.jl`, a Julia package for building Greek morphological parsers, and benefit from implementation strategies developed for Tabulae.[^scala] 

[^scala]: The Tabulae system was previously implemented in Scala ([github](https://github.com/neelsmith/tabulae)).
