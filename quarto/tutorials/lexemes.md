# Vocabulary

## Key points

- Vocabulary in the `ls` collection shares identifiers with the articles in the online [Lewis and Short Dictionary](http://folio2.furman.edu/lewis-short/index.html) from Furman University. E.g., the lexeme `ls.n14736` (*donum*) has a corresponding Lewis-Short article `urn:cite2:hmt:ls.markdown:n14736`.


## TBA

!!! info "TBA: labelling lexemes"

    A forthcoming release of `Tabulae.jl` will include functions for labelling lexeme identifiers with Lewis-Short lemmata.
