# Appendices: automated paradigms


The appendices in this section of the site include automatically generated paradigms.

Verb paradigms are presented in two orthographies, one with 25 alphabetic characters, distinguishing vocalic "i" and "u" from consonontal or semivocalic "j" and "v," and one  with 23 alphabetic characters using "i" and "u" for both vocalic and consonantal sounds.
