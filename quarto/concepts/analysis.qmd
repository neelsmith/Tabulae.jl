title: "Morphological analysis"
---

Morphological analysis of a lexical token follows the model of the `CitableParserBuilder` package. It comprises four pieces of information, each of which can be identified by URN value. Two items give the results of the analysis:

- the lexeme
- the morphological form


Two items explain how the analysis was derived:

- the rule 
- the stem
