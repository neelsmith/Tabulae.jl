This section explains what makes Tabulae different from other approaches to Latin morphological parsing.


## Key points



- Tabulae *datasets* are composed of tables of inflectional rules, and tables of vocabulary stems.
- Each dataset follows a specified *orthography*.
- *Forms* and *lexemes* are identified by URNs that are independent of orthography.
- Datasets are compatible between the Scala and Julia implementations of Tabulae.
- Data tables use *abbreviated URNs*; adding a URN registry to the dataset allows expanding abbreviated URNs to full `Cite2Urn`s.
- `Tabulae.jl` is a pure Julia system: it has no external dependencies
- `Tabulae.jl` implements the model of citable morphological parsing defined the `CitableParserBuilders` package ([documentation](https://neelsmith.quarto.pub/citableparserbuilder/))


## Architecture


### Datasets

- datasets: datamainted in stem and rules directories 
- rule types and stem types
- IO readers for reading/writing datasets

### Building parser

- Cartesian product of rules `*` stems, filtered on inflectional class
