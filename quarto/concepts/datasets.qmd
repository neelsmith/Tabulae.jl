A dataset is a set of delimited-text files in an explicitly defined orthography. 

- stems tables
- rules tables

The file layout follows a set of conventions. (See reference section for full definition.)


- format of delimited text representation specific to type, but all use generic serialization from `CitableBase` package (`cex` and `fromcex` functions)

## Example of a noun stem

```{julia}
#| warning: false
#| 
using Tabulae, CitableBase

stemdelimited = "latcommon.noun1626|ls.n1626|agricol|masculine|a_ae"
nounstem = fromcex(stemdelimited, TabulaeNounStem)
```

```{julia}
cex(nounstem)
```

These can always be round tripped:

```{julia}
fromcex(stemdelimited, TabulaeNounStem) |> cex == stemdelimited
```

## Example of a noun rule

- stem and rule always joined by inflectional type
- for nouns, also by gender



```{julia}
ruledelimited = "latcommoninfl.a_ae16|a_ae|am|masculine|accusative|singular"
nounrule = fromcex(ruledelimited, TabulaeNounRule)
```
