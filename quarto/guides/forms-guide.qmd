- there is a citable collection of forms
- each form is identified by URN

## Constructing objects for morphological forms

- you can construct a form object directly from a URN
- you can construct a form object from a string code which is the object component of the URN




Values for morphological form are expressed with types that have names beginning with `LMF` (for "Latin Morphological Form").  Each type has a corresponding function beginning with lowercase `lmf` that can construct an instance of the type from either a numeric code or a type-specific list of string values.


## Working with morphological form objects

- get its urn
- get a label for it
- retrieve its properties
