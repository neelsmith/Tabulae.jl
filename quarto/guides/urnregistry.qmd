# Setting up a URN registry for your dataset


## Outline

- organized in three subdirectories of the dataset's `urnregistry` directory:
     - `lexemes`
     - `rules`
     - `stems`
- identical three-column delimited text files: collection ID, collection URN, label
- as many file names as you like ending in `.cex`; empty lines OK


Example:


```
CollectionId|CollectionUrn|Label
ls|urn:cite2:shot:ls.v1:|Latin lexical entities appearing in Lewis-Short's Latin Dictionary.
```
