Tabulae rule sets can be serialized to a simple uniform structure with four an identifier for the rule, an inflectional type, a string value for an ending, and an identifier for a Latin morphological form.

## Expanded vs. succinct serialization


### Outline

- forms can be expressed in succinct with a simple identifier
- forms can be expressed with values for each property. In this expanded form 


### Example: serializing from web

```{julia}
#| warning: false
#| output: false
using Tabulae, CitableBase
url = "http://shot.holycross.edu/tabulae/rules-current.cex"
# rules = ruleset(url, UrlReader)
```
