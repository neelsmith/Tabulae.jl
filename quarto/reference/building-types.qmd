# Overview of the infrastructure for an analytical type ("part of speech")

## Forms

- citable form `<: LatinMorphologicalForm`: compile list of needed or required functions. e.g. `LMFPronoun` (note name convention)

## Building forms

Dataset with table for rules, stems

- citable rules object: eg `TabulaePronounRule`
- citable stems object: eg `TabulaePronounStem`

## Parsing

Parsing will work automatically once the following functions are implemented:

on stem:

- `inflectionclass`
- `stemvalue`
- `lexeme`
- `formurn` unless the type is "build from rule"
- `urn`

on rule:

- `inflectionclass`
- `ending`
- `formurn` if the type is "build from rule" (irregulars, uninflected, pronouns)
- `urn`
