# Stems

Each stem entry is identified by an abbreviated URN, and identifies a lexeme with a second abbreviated URN.

All stem types have a string value to use for the stem of the resulting form, and an inflectional class that indicates what category of inflectional endings should be applied to the stem.

!!! note "Inflectional classes"

    See the reference section on inflectional types for more detailed information about inflectional classes.
