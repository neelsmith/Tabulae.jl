## Outline

- subtypes of TabulaeStem
- implement `readstemrow` and `writestemrow` using a subtype of `TabulaeIO`
- implement `lexeme`
- implement `inflectiontype` and `stemvalue`
- (nouns implement `lmpGender` since it is inherent to the stem)
- implement functions for citability in CITE architecture (the stem itself is a citable object)
